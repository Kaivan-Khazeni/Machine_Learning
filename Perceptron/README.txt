This is the folder for Perceptron:

Details and Instructions:

In my main_Perceptron file, I have helper methods for the three algorithms
  - Standard, Voted, Average

I include a bank-note folder that contains the csv files that I read with pandas.

I included a .sh file for the ease of running my code
Once run, it will print 
1. Standard Weigth Vector and Average Prediction Error
2. Voted Weight Vectors and C counts for them, then the Voted Final Vector with Voted Average Prediction Rate
3. Average Weight Vector and the Average Average Prediction Error

The weight vector includes the bias term as the first value since I fold the bias term into X and weight vector.
