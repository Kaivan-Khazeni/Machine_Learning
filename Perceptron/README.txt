This is the instructions for Perceptron HW3

File is main_Perceptron.py

Contains Shell File .sh to run

Shell will print the weight vectors (with bias folded in as the first value) with the average prediction error 
for all three algorithms - Standard, Voted, and Average

I use helper methods for the three implementations and this folder contains bank-note data as well.
