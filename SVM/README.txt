HW4 Notes:

In this HW4, I have two methods : subgradient a and subgradient b, the only difference is the required change in the learning rate, which I do complete.

Another method is obj_function which is the objective function of for Q3A where we use the dual, and the corresponding dual method that completes the function and 
finds the optimal W and Bias terms.

I did not get to the dual gaussian or part c, as of right now this is incomplete until otherwise noted.
