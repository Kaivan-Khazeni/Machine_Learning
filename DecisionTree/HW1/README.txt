HW1:
Directions

All my code is going to run via function calls in main.  I have seperate functions that perform ID3, entropy/ME/Gini calculations.
Main will run the "get error" functions and print the error via data frames.  

NOTE:
My run time on the bank data is LONG.  Approximately 30 minutes per problem (3A,3B) therefore in case this is tested, it will take a long time.
This can be because of data frame splitting and column filtering, or my general algorithm but it is a long run time.
The run time is fast for cars but slow for bank.

If you have any questions please email me at : u1135484@gcloud.utah.edu
