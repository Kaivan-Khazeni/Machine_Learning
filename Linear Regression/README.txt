This is the folder for Linear Regression:

Details and Instructions:

In my main method, I have a cost function method, a batch and stochastic method respectively, with print helper methods for figures and data print out


I have left comments in thhe main method as well for guidance


The methods commented out are "print_batch" and "print_stochastic".  By uncommenting this, it will run the respective methods.


The default print will be the uncommented analytical form of solving for the weight vector which will print out the weight vector.


NOTE: run the batch and stochastic individually as the plots will not print together.
